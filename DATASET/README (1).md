Predicting Air Quality Levels using advanced machine learing algorithms for environmental insights
'''1. Data Loading and Initial Processing
Input: Multiple CSV files containing climate data

Algorithm:

   Load datasets using pandas (pd.read_csv())

   Display initial rows of each dataset (head())

   Drop all rows with NaN values (dropna())


2. Data Transformation
  Key Operations:

     Create a to_year() function to extract year from date strings

     Apply this function to create new 'year' columns

     Filter data for specific countries (e.g., United States)

     Calculate yearly average temperatures
3. Visualization Algorithms
Scatter Plots:

        *Create temperature scatter plots for above/below 9°C thresholds

        *Use colormaps (coolwarm) for visual encoding

 Heatmaps:

        *Generate correlation heatmaps for all datasets using Seaborn

Time Series Plots:

    Create interactive plots with Plotly showing CO₂ trends

     Implement three visualization techniques:

        *Raw data points

        *Rolling average (3-period window)

        *Exponential weighted moving average

4. Machine Learning Pipeline
    Linear Regression Model:

        Feature engineering: [year, month, month², year²]

        Train/test split (60/40)

        Fit linear regression model

        Achieves high accuracy (99.6%)

    Prediction:

       Generate predictions for future years (1950-2055)

       Visualize predictions vs actual data

5. Additional Analyses
    Extreme value identification (max/min temperatures by location)

    Country-level analysis merging temperature and CO₂ data

    Data grouping and sorting operations

Key Algorithmic Patterns
        Data Cleaning Pipeline: Consistent NaN handling across all datasets

        Time Series Processing: Year/month extraction and aggregation

        Visual Analytics: Multiple complementary visualization techniques

        Predictive Modeling: Simple but effective linear regression approach

        Interactive Exploration: Using Plotly for dynamic visualizations

The algorithm follows a typical data science workflow: data loading → cleaning → exploration → modeling → visualization, with particular focus on temporal patterns in climate data.'''
